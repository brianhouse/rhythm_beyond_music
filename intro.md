## Thematic

What do we mean by nonhuman?
- inhuman (antagonistic or hostile)
- posthuman (technology oriented)
- more-than-human (interchangeable, perhaps better)


## Material

- geophysical, animals, and AI --> focus on art-science

- contemporary art

- to an extent arbitrary because of the vastness, but I've come up with a provisional reading list, which we can alter

- it's all mixed up, to avoid distinctions in considering the idea of the nonhuman

- we can find our own path week to week

- part of what we're reading is its relevance to our topic

- funding for materials?



## Structure

Inspired by a graduate seminar like you would find in a Media Studies PhD. How that works is that everyone takes turns giving a review of a text, which then sets off a discussion, with a new text every week. Those reviews are like mini-papers, and then they inform a larger paper that is written and presented.

In this case, because it's studio art, we're not only dealing with texts, but with artworks, and instead of a written a paper, it's producing studio work. 

I made a mistake in making this a 400-level course in the Spring semester; difficult for Amherst art and FAMS students to take. With three people I think we can still do it, but we'll keep the presentations on the texts very informal.

special topics / research group

So how I see this going is like this: we'll all read a paper for every class, and come with thoughts and questions, which we'll all present and talk about.

You will all propose artistic resesarch projects, and then we'll track the development of those as well.

## My Role

Unlike in a regular class, I'm not necessarily the expert here. My work has touched on this work. But there are things I want to explore further.
