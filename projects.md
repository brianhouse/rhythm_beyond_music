# Projects

Your miderm and final projects in this course are of your own design. You may explore any of the themes that have arisen in the course of our discussions in class and incorporate any studio method.

Keep in mind the short timeframe, and plan your work accordingly. That said, the emphasis in these projects is on process, not product.

## Proposal

Your proposal should be a Google Slides / Keynote / PowerPoint presentation that consists of:
- An explanation of the concept you want to explore
- Three artistic precedents that we've seen in class or that you've independently researched
- Your idea
- The technical approach you are planning on taking
- What you need to learn 
- What materials you are planning on using
- Questions for the class regarding your idea or its execution

Turn in your proposal on Moodle and be prepared to talk about it in class.


## Process Documentation

An important part of experimental artwork is documenting your process. This might feel awkward at first, but it will be of great benefit to you down the road. Documentation can take many forms, but it should include written notes along with images. You will use this material to present to the class on your progress each week.


## Final Documentation

In addition to presenting your work for critique, the final deliverable for your project must include final documentation. This consists of a title, a 3-sentence artist description, and media of some kind (preferrably a video, but this may depend on the nature of the work). As opposed to the process documentation, final documentation is intended to be something you would include in a portfolio.

If you are making a video, it should be 1–2 mins long. You may use your phone, but film in **landscape**, [use AE/AF Lock](https://improvephotography.com/53127/what-is-ae-af-lock-on-an-iphone-and-how-does-that-help-my-pictures/), and use a tripod (tripods are available in 303). You do not need titles or a spoken explanation—if possible, visually tell the story of your work.
